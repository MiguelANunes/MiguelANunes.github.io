Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Miguel Alfredo Nunes, I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science by the
State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC in the portuguese acronym) and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in
philosophy at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), where the theme of my dissertation is logic and combinations of logics.

My main goal with this blog is writing about the things I'm researching about in my master's, things that I'm studying and
find interesting, as well as eventual digressions into academic life (and it's hardships) and whatever else I may want to write about.

Another goal with this blog is practicing my writing in other languages. Currently, aside from portuguese, I'll only be writing in english,
as I've yet to learn german, but once I have I'll slowly translate the pages and posts.

My social media are for friends only, but you may find me at:

- [GitHub][github];
- [LinkedIn][linkedin].

For academic purposes, you may find me at:

- [Lattes][lattes] (brazilian standard academic curricula);
- [ORCID][orcid];
- [Google Scholar][scholar].

I wont add my full e-mail to avoid (even more) spam, but it is
<code style="background-color: rgb(38, 41, 34)">my.full.name@gmail.com</code>.

This blog is based on [Jekyll][jekyll], published by [GitHub Pages][ghp], the theme I'm using
is a customization of the [Hydeout][hydeout] theme and multi language support was implemented base on a tutorial
by Ulrich R., available [here][ulrich]. I'm thank for my friend
[João Vitor Fröhlich][jvf] for his many suggestions and his help during the development of this blog.
